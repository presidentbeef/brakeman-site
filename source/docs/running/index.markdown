The simplest way to get started with Brakeman is to just run it with no options in the root directory of your Rails application:

    cd your_rails_app/
    brakeman

This will scan the application in the current directory and output a report to the command line.

Alternatively, you can supply a path as an option to Brakeman:

    brakeman your_rails_app

Even more specifically:

    brakeman -p your_rails_app
