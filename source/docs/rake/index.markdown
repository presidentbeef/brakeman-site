**Running Brakeman via Rake is discouraged because it loads the entire Rails application.** This is unnecessary and can cause strange behavior.

### Example

Here is a simple Rake task to run Brakeman. It can be added to your `Rakefile` or in the `tasks/` directory.

    namespace :brakeman do

      desc "Run Brakeman"
      task :run, :output_files do |t, args|
        require 'brakeman'

        files = args[:output_files].split(' ') if args[:output_files]
        Brakeman.run :app_path => ".", :output_files => files, :print_report => true
      end
    end

This task will run Brakeman with no options. If given an output file, it will save the report in that file. Otherwise, it will print the report out to the console.

To use this task:

    rake brakeman:run

or

    rake brakeman:run[report.html]

This task can easily be customized. See [Brakeman as a Library](/docs/brakeman_as_a_library) for more information.
