In Rails 3.1, a new feature was added to simplify basic authentication.

The example provided in the official [Rails Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html) looks like this:

    class PostsController < ApplicationController

      http_basic_authenticate_with :name => "dhh", :password => "secret", :except => :index

      #...

    end

This warning will be raised if `http_basic_authenticate_with` is used and the password is found to be a string (i.e., stored somewhere in the code).
