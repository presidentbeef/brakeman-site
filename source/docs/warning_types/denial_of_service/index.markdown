Denial of Service (DoS) is any attack which causes a service to become unavailable for legitimate clients.

Denial of Service can be caused by consuming large amounts of network, memory, or CPU resources.

### Regex DoS

If an attacker can control the content of a regular expression, they may be able to construct a regular expression that requires exponential time to run.

Brakeman will warn about dynamic regular expressions that inject user-supplied values.

For example:

    some.values.any? { |v| v.match /#{params[:query]}/ }

### Symbol DoS

[Prior to Ruby 2.2](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2014/12/25/ruby-2-2-0-released/), Symbols were not garbage collected. Creation of large numbers of Symbols could lead to a server running out of memory.

If the application appears to be using an older version of Ruby, Brakeman checks for code where user input which is converted to a Symbol. When this is not restricted, an attacker could create an unlimited number of Symbols.

Note: This is an optional check which can be enabled with `--enable SymbolDoS` or `--run-all-checks`.
