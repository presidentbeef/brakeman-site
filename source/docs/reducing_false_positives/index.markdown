By default, Brakeman reports as much as possible. Because there is no way for Brakeman to know if certain items are actually safe or not, it errs on the side of reporting _too much_ rather than possibly not reporting a real problem. Sometimes, though, these false positives can become overwhelming. Brakeman does provides many options for customizing reports. It is also possible [to ignore specific warnings](/docs/ignoring_false_positives).

It is recommended to always run Brakeman with the default settings first (and then periodically after that), but it is possible to narrow down the results to make them less annoying.

### Specify Checks to Run

When running Brakeman, one can specify a set of checks to run or a set to exclude using the `--test` or `--except`, respectively. These options take a comma-separated list of check names, which are case-sensitive. Use `brakeman --checks` to get a list of the exact check names.

For example, to only check for SQL injection and cross-site scripting:

    brakeman --test CheckSQL,CheckCrossSiteScripting

_('Check' can actually be omitted from the names.)_

To exclude checks for dynamic render paths:

    brakeman --except CheckRender

### Set Confidence Threshold

Getting a ton of weak confidence warnings? Use `-w3` to only report high confidence warnings or `-w2` to only report high and medium confidence warnings.

(Use of `-w3` is not recommended, however.)

### Mark Methods as Safe

If an applications has custome sanitizing methods or just methods which are known to be safe, then the `--safe-methods` option can be used to ignore those methods. Specify the methods as a comma-separated list.

For example:

    brakeman --safe-methods this_one,that_one,totally_safe,my_sanitizer

### Only Reporting Direct Vulnerabilities

With the default settings, Brakeman will report cross-site scripting vulnerabilities if the return value of a method where user input is a _parameter_ is output.

For example, this will raise a warning unless `some_method` is marked as safe like above:

    <%= some_method(params[:blah]) %>

To ignore this kind of output, use the `--report-direct` option. This also applies to some other situations, such as checking calls to `redirect_to`.

### Ignoring Model Attributes

Brakeman assumes database values are suspect (and so should you). But for some applications this does not make sense. Use the `--ignore-model-output` option to suppress reporting model attributes as cross-site scripting vulnerabilities.
