Brakeman Pi!


## Code Climate Fingerprints

The output format for Code Climate has been updated to include warning fingerprints as generated by Brakeman.

## Ignored secrets.yml

If `secrets.yml` is ignored via `.gitignore`, Brakeman will ignore it, too.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/781))

## Safe YAML Error

For some people, in some cases, `date` is not loaded prior to loading `safe_yaml`. This release ensures `date` is loaded before using SafeYAML and only loads `safe_yaml` on demand.

## Test Coverage and Warning Cleanup

Thanks to Zander Mackie for improving test coverage (up to 91.24%) by writing tests for the command line options and thanks to Andy Waite for cleaning up various Ruby warnings.
