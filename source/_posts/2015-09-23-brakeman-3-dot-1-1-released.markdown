This release includes two new checks and a number of bug fixes.


## Session Manipulation Check

As suggested by [Joernchen](https://twitter.com/joernchen), Brakeman will now look for user input in session keys which can lead to session manipulation.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/720))

## Optional Check for Weak Hashes

An optional check to look for use of MD5 and SHA1 has been added to this release. Run with `-t WeakHash` to use just this optional check or `-A` to run all checks.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/722))

## Windows Paths

[Cody Frederick](https://github.com/spcoder) fixed an issue with determining absolute paths on Windows.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/714))

## Search for Methods by Regex

[Alex Ianus](https://github.com/aianus) re-introduced the ability to search the CallIndex with regular expressions for methods:

    tracker.find_call(method: /_something$/)

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/710))

## Haml Processing

Haml users may have noticed warnings with `find_and_preserve(Haml::Filters::Javascript.render_with_options(...))` in them. This has been fixed so `find_and_preserve` is treated as though it just passes through its arguments. Calls to `render_with_options` will be treated as unescaped output. 

Along with this change, `j` and `escape_javascript` will be considered safe inside `:javascript` filters in Haml.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/716))

## Chained Assignment

Chained assignments like `a = b = c = 1` will now be handled correctly. This fixes [a very old issue from 2012](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11314450/how-to-secure-link-to-variable-cross-site-scripting-vulnerabilities).

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/718))

## Trying More

While Brakeman already treated `a.try(:b)` like `a.b()`, there is a surprising amount of code which does `a.try(&:b)`. This is totally unncessary, but Brakeman now handles it as well.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/717))

## More Arel Whitelisting

A number of Arel methods have been whitelisted to avoid warning about them inside SQL query building.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/719))

## Decorated Models in Links

If the Draper gem is used, Brakeman will ignore calls to `decorate` in `link_to`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/721))

## terminal-table

Newer [terminal-table](https://github.com/tj/terminal-table) releases are supported now and the dependency has been relaxed.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/712))
