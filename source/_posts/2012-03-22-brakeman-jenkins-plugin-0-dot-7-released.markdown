The [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org)/[Hudson](http://hudson-ci.org) plugin which tracks, displays, and alerts on Brakeman warnings has been updated to work with the latest static analysis core plugin. In particular, this means warning thresholds for new warnings will no longer disappear.

See [here](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Brakeman+Plugin) for more information about the plugin.

Thanks to Nick Green for fixing this!
