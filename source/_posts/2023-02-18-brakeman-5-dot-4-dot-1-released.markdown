Several changes in this release are updates to Brakeman's open redirect check.


## Rails 6.1 and Rails 7.0 Defaults

The default configuration values for Rails 6.1 and Rails 7.0 have been added to Brakeman.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1751))

## Open Redirect Updates

Rails 7 introduced a new protection against open directs.

If `config.action_controller.raise_on_open_redirects` is set to `true`, then Rails prevents redirects that redirect to a different domain than `request.host`.
This protection can be bypassed by passing in `allow_other_host: true` to `redirect_to`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1755))

[Lachlan Sylvester](https://github.com/lsylvester) pointed out it's also possible to use `url_from` to ensure a URL is for the same host. So `redirect_to(url_from(params[:url]))` is safe.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1749))

This release also expands the open redirect check to `redirect_back` and `redirect_back_or_to` which have options for a fallback URL.

## More Unscoped Finds 

Brakeman will now warn about use of `find_by(id: ...)` the same way it would warn about `find_by_id` for "unscoped finds" (i.e., possible insecure direct object references).

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1748))

## Presence Method Support

Brakeman now handles `presence`, `presence_in`, and `in?` methods.

Since `presence_in` and `in?` are often used for guard clauses, this fixes some false positives.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1747))

## File/Line for End-Of-Life Warnings

March is nearly here, which means support for Ruby 2.7 is ending!

Thanks to [Jon Burns](https://github.com/jburns42891) for pointing out Brakeman was reporting the wrong file and/or line number for EOL Ruby warnings.
