_Changes since 4.0.0_:

* Do not use pager when `CI` environment variable is set

## New Default Exit Codes

`--exit-on-warn` and `--exit-on-error` are now default behavior.

If any warnings are found or errors are raised during the scan, Brakeman's exit code will be non-zero. This may break things! In particular, CI jobs or scripts that assume Brakeman will exit normally.

You may use `--no-exit-on-warn` and `--no-exit-on-error` to revert back to previous behavior and always exit with error code 0.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1085) and [changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1086))

## New Default Report Format

The "plain" report format is now the default.

To revert back to the table format, use `-f tables` or `-o report.tables`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1084))

## Paged Output

By default, output to the terminal will be paged with `less` or Highline's simple pager.

To disable, use `--no-pager`.

In 4.0.1 Brakeman will automatically disable the pager when the `CI` environment variable is set to `true`. This should be compatible with Travis CI, Circle CI, Codeship, and Bitbucket Pipelines.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1098))

## Fewer Mass Assignment Warnings

Low confidence mass assignment warnings have been removed in this release. Brakeman should now only warn when user input is used directly in the instantiation or update of a model.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1087))

## Fewer `link_to` Warnings

Warnings about XSS in `link_to` have confused quite a few people over the years. The danger is that links may have `javascript:` or `data:` values with XSS payloads.

Brakeman should now only warn when directly using user input or when using what looks like a URL from the database.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1093))

## More Cookies

`request.cookies` will now be treated like cookies in general.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1094))

## More Early Returns

Calls to `raise` or `fail` will be treated like early returns when considering simple guard expressions.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1089)) 

## Cross-Site Scripting

Messages about "Cross Site Scripting" will now include a hyphen. This does not affect warning fingerprints.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/936))

## CONFIDENCE

Brakeman checks previously used the `CONFIDENCE` hash when creating warnings, e.g. `:confidence => CONFIDENCE[:high]`. Now it's possible to use `:confidence => :high` instead.

For those with custom checks, the `CONFIDENCE` hash is still available and nothing should break.
