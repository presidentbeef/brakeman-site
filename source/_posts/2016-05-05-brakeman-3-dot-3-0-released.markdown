Brakeman 3.3.0 introduces a new packaging method for Brakeman which vendors all dependencies and does not include any gem dependencies in the gemspec. Please test and provide feedback if it does not work as expected.


## Dependency Bundling

In its gem form, Brakeman no longer declares any external dependencies. Its dependencies are bundled with the gem itself. This should prevent the conflicts which sometimes occur when Brakeman is declared as a dependency of a Rails application. The disadvantage is you will no longer be able to update Brakeman dependencies (like RubyParser) without updating Brakeman itself.

As this is a new way of distributing Brakeman, please report any issues that may arise.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/845))

## New Exit Code

A new exit code has been added for the case when Brakeman does not detect a Rails application.

For reference, these are Brakeman's current exit codes:

* `0` - Normal exit
- `3` - Warnings found (with `-z`)
- `4` - No Rails application detected
* `255` - Error

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/870))

## Secrets Check

A new optional check has been added to look for hard-coded secrets in the source code. It will warn when constants like `PASSWORD` are assigned string literals. To run the new check, use `-t Secrets` or `-A` to run all checks including optional ones.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/861))

## Constant Values

This release includes initial support for tracking and matching constants across the application. For example, if a model contains a constant `Model::KEYS` which is used elsewhere, Brakeman should be able to track this value. This helps prevents false positives when safe values have been declared as constants.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/855))

## Skipping Test Code

Brakeman will now ignore `if` branches that check `Rails.env.test?`. Additionally, branch skipping behavior (e.g. `if false...`) has been expanded to most of Brakeman's processing instead of just in data flow analysis.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/868))

## HAML `find_and_preserve`

Brakeman will now handle uses of `find_and_preserve` in HAML with a block.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/839))

## Array#first

Calls to `Array#first` will be replaced with the first value in the array when known.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/856))

## Forgery Option

[Jason Yeo](https://github.com/jsyeo) provided a fix for when Brakeman encounters a non-Hash argument to `protect_from_forgery`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/849))

## `u` Helper

[Chad Dollins](https://github.com/cdollins) fixed XSS false positives when the `u` alias for `url_encode` is used.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/863))

## Fewer `slice` False Positives

Brakeman should no longer warn when using `params.slice` in mass assignment, SQL injection, links, and open redirects.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/867) and [other changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/871))

## Safe popen

Brakeman will no longer warn about uses of `popen` when the argument is an array, in which case the arguments are escaped.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/854))

## Code Climate Engine

[Gordon Diggs](https://github.com/GordonDiggs) provided several improvements to the Code Climate Engine in this release:

* Remove `nil` entries from the `include_paths` option
* Force output to stdout when possible
* Report end lines to conform with spec
