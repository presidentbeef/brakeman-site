This release updates Haml support to Haml 5.x!


## Haml Support Update

Haml 5 introduced a completely different "compiled" format, so adding support was a significant effort taking a few months to complete.
Due to the large number of changes, you may expect some changes to warnings for Haml templates.

Please report any bugs or odd behavior with Haml templates!

Haml 3.x and 4.x are no longer supported, although in general Haml is mostly backwards-compatible.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1397))

## Shell Commands

[Jacob Evelyn](https://github.com/JacobEvelyn) added support for detecting command injection with `-c` in known-dangerous commands (such as `bash` or `echo`).

An example of dangerous code would be:

    system("echo", "-c", params[:command])

Of course not all dangerous shell commands are covered - so in general be careful passing any user-controlled input to a shell command.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1396/))

## CookieSerialization Bug

[Phil Turnbull](https://github.com/philipturnbull) fixed an issue in `CheckCookieSerialization` where non-symbol cookie serialization options were handled poorly.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1391))

## Brakeman::Differ Refactor

[Benoit Côté-Jodoin](https://github.com/Becojo) refactored `Brakeman::Differ` to compare warnings more efficiently and remove old fallback behavior.
All warnings are compared by fingerprint now when using `--compare`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1406))

## Version Comparisons

[Andrey Glushkov](https://github.com/aglushkov) updated the code for comparing library versions so it uses `Gem::Version` and handles "beta"/pre-release versions better.


([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1405))

## %W Interpolation

String interpolation when using `%W` is no longer considered dangerous in shell commands where regular interpolation would be.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1408))

## `form_for`

`form_for` is considered a safe method in XSS checks.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1397/commits/a99cb25c6e76eb6240589f3a399e1245c0514257))

## String.new

`String.new << 'some string'` is now treated like `'' << 'some string'`.
