This release drops support for running Brakeman with versions of Ruby older than 2.3.0. As always, scanning code with older syntax continues to be supported.

Also in this release: better supported for embedded "filters" in templates and (relatedly) the Sass dependency was removed!

_Changes since 4.4.0:_

* Officially drop support for running with older Ruby versions
* More thoroughly handle `Shellwords` escaping ([#1323](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/1323))
* Handle non-integer version number comparisons ([#1305](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/1305))
* Better handling of splat/kwsplat arguments ([#1204](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/1204))
* Handle `**` inside Hash literals
* Add support for CoffeeScript in Slim templates
* Improve support for embedded template "filters"
* Remove Sass dependency
* Avoid joining strings with different encodings
* Improve "user input" reported for SQL injection
* Stop swallowing exceptions in `AliasProcessor`
* Add original exception to `Tracker#errors` list
* Use `FileParser` in `Scanner` to parse files
* Set location information in `CheckContentTag`
* Update RubyParser to 3.13.0

### Dropped Support for Older Rubies

Brakeman code will no longer attempt to maintain compatibility with Ruby 1.9.3, instead setting the minimum version to Ruby 2.3.0.

Note that Ruby 2.2.0 reached end of life almost a year ago and is no longer receiving security updates.

This does *not* affect the versions of Ruby code Brakeman can analyze. Thanks to RubyParser, scanning syntax back to Ruby 1.8 is still supported. 

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1329))

### More Shell Escaping

Brakeman is now better at handling shell escaping with `Shellwords` when checking for command injection. 

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1327))

### Non-Integer Version Numbers

When comparing non-integer version numbers (e.g., `"beta1"`), Brakeman will compare integers to integers and strings to strings instead of
incorrectly converting some strings to integers.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1326))

### More Splats

Splat args (`*arg`) and double splat/keyword splats (`**kwargs`) are better supported now (instead of being ignored).
Keyward splats inside of hash literals will be merged into the hash literal.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1315))

### Embedded Template Filters

Support for embedded filters in templates (e.g. `markdown` inside of Haml or Slim) has been completely rewritten. As a result, it is simpler to support embedded filters *and* it was possible to drop the Sass dependency. (The Sass gem itself is deprecated and will be [end of life as of March 31st, 2019](https://sass-lang.com/ruby-sass).)

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1314))

### String Encoding

Previously, it was possible to run into errors when Brakeman attempted to join or concatenate strings with different encodings. Now it will just fail and leave the strings apart.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1293))

### Better Reporting of SQL Injection

SQL injection warnings now have better information about which value triggered the warning. Previously, sometimes the value highlighted as "dangerous" was misleading and confusing.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1297))

### RubyParser Updated 

Thanks to [Ryan Davis](http://www.zenspider.com/), RubyParser now has better support for newer Ruby 2.5 and Ruby 2.6 syntax, along with many other fixes!

This should address many of the parsing errors folks have been seeing.
