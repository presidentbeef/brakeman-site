This is a quick release to add warnings for [CVE-2016-6316](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ruby-security-ann/8B2iV2tPRSE/JkjCJkSoCgAJ) and [CVE-2016-6317](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/ruby-security-ann/WccgKSKiPZA/9DrsDVSoCgAJ). There was a bug in 3.3.4 that affected debug output which has been fixed in 3.3.5.


*Changes since 3.3.4*:

* Fix bug in reports when using `--debug` 

## CVE-2016-6316

Typically Rails will escape attribute values passed to tag helpers like `content_tag`. If the attribute has already been marked as "safe" with `.html_safe` or (more likely) a different escaping helper like `sanitize`, the tag helper will not escape the value again (that is the purpose of `.html_safe`). However, not all sanitizers/escape methods escape double quotes, which are dangerous inside of tag attributes. In particular, double quotes allow an attacker to close the current attribute and insert new attributes (like `onmouseover`) that can execute JavaScript.

Brakeman will issue a generic warning about CVE-2016-6316 for affected versions and may generate warnings for potentially dangerous calls to `content_tag`.

## CVE-2016-6317

The [JSON bug](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/8SA-M3as7A8/Mr9fi9X4kNgJ) is back. Specially-crafted queries can cause parameters to be interpreted as empty hashes, which may cause unexpected behavior in SQL queries.

Brakeman will generate a generic warning for affected versions (4.2 series).

## Minitest

Unrelated, Brakeman now uses Minitest instead of test-unit.
