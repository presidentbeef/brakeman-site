Changes:

 * Fix Rails 3 configuration parsing
 * Check both t() and translate() for cross-site scripting bug

Just a small release to get the Rails 3 config fix out.

## Rails 3 Configuration Parsing

There was an issue that would cause Brakeman to crash on certain configurations. This has been fixed.

## Look for t()

Both the `translate` and its shorter alias `t` will cause the warning about the cross-site scripting bug in them to be set to high confidence. If neither of these functions are found in the application, the confidence is set to medium.
