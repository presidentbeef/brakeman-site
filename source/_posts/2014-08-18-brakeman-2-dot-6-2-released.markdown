This release is mostly bug fixes and updates, but does include two new options.


## Mass Assignment Bypass (CVE-2014-3514)

[CVE-2014-3514](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/rubyonrails-security/M4chq5Sb540/CC1Fh0Y_NWwJ) describes an issue where  `create_with` does not implement strong parameters, allowing mass assignment in Rails 4.x. For vulnerable versions, Brakeman warns about instances of `create_with` or a generic warning if no uses are found.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/540))

## External Check Option

[Clint Gibler](https://github.com/clintgibler) has added the `--add-checks-path` option to provide an path to search for additional checks. This is useful if you wish to write your own custom rules for Brakeman to run.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/532))

## Option to Force Rails 4

If the Rails version for an application cannot be determined automatically for some reason, the `-4` option will force Brakeman to treat it like a Rails 4 application.

Included with this change are some fixes when a Rails 4 app is detected but the exact version number cannot be determined. This may change the output for some scans.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/527))

## SQL Injection in Nested Strings

This release fixes some SQL injection detection when there is lots of string building mixing concatenation and interpolation. These changes may also affect which value Brakeman warns about within the string.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/528))

## Better Send Call Detection

Previously, Brakeman was ignored calls to `send` when they were nested inside a chain of calls. This has been fixed.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/524))

## Ignored Secrets

Brakeman now checks subdirectories for `.gitignore` files which determing if the secrets configuration is being ignored.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/521))

## Symbolizing Safe Paramaters

Since `params[:controller]` and `params[:action]` are quite difficult (possibly impossible) to DoS, Brakeman will not warn about symbolizing them.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/538))

## Erubis Fixes

Some ERB templates were not parsing correctly due to how Brakeman was handling the end of blocks. This should be resolved now.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/520))

## Ruby2Ruby Dependency Updated

Brakeman now depends on the latest version of Ruby2Ruby due to the [fix here](https://github.com/seattlerb/ruby2ruby/commit/a1576d12cb1e5e379875548abfd441c6e3095f4a).

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/537))

## Expand App Path Once

[Jeff Rafter]() refactored a bunch of code which was converting the application path to an absolute path and instead moved it to one (okay, maybe two) spots. This should not affect any reports.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/534))

## Error in Controller Processing

[Jason Barnabe](https://github.com/JasonBarnabe) fixed an error...in the error handling when processing controllers.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/517))
