## Rake Option Removed

The Rake task generated by `--rake` has caused quite a few problems. When Rake is run with a Rails application, it loads all of the app's dependencies, which may conflict with Brakeman's dependencies.

It is recommended to either not use a Rake task to run Brakeman or just shell out to Brakeman instead of using it as a library.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1038))

## Check Paths in Config Files

Brakeman allows loading custom checks with `--add-checks-path`.
To avoid silently loading arbitary code, Brakeman will not support this option in configuration files unless explicitly enabled with `--allow-check-paths-in-config`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1052))

## Templates without Format Extension

The [3.5.0 release](http://brakemanscanner.org/blog/2017/01/31/brakeman-3-dot-5-0-released/) added support for templates with a bare extension (like `my_template.haml`) but template names derived internally did not handle these bare extensions properly. When rendering templates, Brakeman was not able to match render names to the correct files.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1041))

## YAML Errors

When checking session settings, Brakeman parses `config/secrets.yml`. Sometimes this file has unsafe values or interpolated code which causes the parsing to fail. Brakeman will now only output a notice about this failure instead of an error.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1047))

## If Expressions in HAML

Typically Brakeman assumes all `if` branches in templates are taken and ignores the condition. This was not happening in all cases in rendered HAML templates.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1035/files))

## `to_s` False Positive with `exists?`

Brakeman will no longer warn about arguments calling `to_s` in `exists?`, since that is the recommended way to avoid SQL injection with that particular method.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1049))

## Better Safe Call Handling

The safe call operation `&.` will be handled better in all checks instead of being ignored.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1033))

## Empty Ifs

This release fixes an issue when finding return values from methods ending in an empty `if` expression.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1053))

## More Template Names

Template file names will now be set when passing code to template rendering libraries, in order to produce better error messages when something goes wrong.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1042))

## Dependencies

RubyParser has been updated to `3.9.0` which resolves some issues.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1048))

Slim is limited to `<3.0.8` since the `3.0.8` gem requires Ruby 2.0.
