*Important*: Contrary to the "Brakeman Philosophy," there is one situation in which Brakeman attempts to load files from an application. This is a security risk since the code in the files would be executed (typical `require` behavior). Note that this is only a real problem if running Brakeman against code outside one's control. Since most users are scanning their own code, this should not be a concern for the majority of Brakeman users.


## Custom Haml Filters

Brakeman no longer attempts to load custom Haml filters. This was a hack (from nearly three years ago) to help compile some Haml templates. It was recently noted that this introduces a security risk when scanning untrusted code.

For now, custom Haml filters will cause a Brakeman error and the Haml templates using them will not be scanned.

## JSON Output in Rails 4

As of Rails 4, the output of `to_json` is now safe by default. Brakeman should no longer warn about cross-site scripting with `to_json` in Rails 4 applications.

## Less Fuzzy Mass Assignment

Brakeman no longer uses fuzzy matching for potentially dangerous model attributes allowed for mass assignment, such as any value containing `admin`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/390))

## Text Report Width Option

The width of text reports can now be controlled with the `--table-width` option. For example, this can be useful when capturing text output to a file.
