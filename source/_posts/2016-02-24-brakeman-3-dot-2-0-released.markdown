This release sheds a couple dependencies and adds support for new Ruby 2.3 syntax.


## Ruby 2.3 Lonely Operator

With the update of RubyParser to 3.8.1 (and Ruby2Ruby to 2.3), Brakeman now supports the new `&.` operator and should treat it like a regular method call.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/827))

## CoffeeScript in HAML

This release handles CoffeeScript embedded in HAML better and should reduce some false positives.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/817))

## Render Warnings on Safe Parameters

Brakeman will no longer warn on `render params[:action]` or `render params[:controller]`, as those values are not able to be controlled by an attacker.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/816))

## 'Ignore' Configuration Changes

The "ignore config" files generated by Brakeman are now sorted and will only update on changes, instead of always writing a new file.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/828))

## Index Calls Outside Methods

Calls that are outside methods (but inside class bodies) can now be found in Brakeman checks.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/815))

## Skip Symbol DoS with Rails 5

Rails 5 requires Ruby >= 2.2.2, which now garbage collects symbols. If the `SymbolDoS` check is run on a Rails 5 application (it's already optional), it will no longer warn.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/829))

## Dependency Removal

Since Ruby 1.8 is no longer supported, this release removes the legacy `fastercsv` and `multi-json` dependencies.

([fastercsv](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/822), [multi-json](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/818))
