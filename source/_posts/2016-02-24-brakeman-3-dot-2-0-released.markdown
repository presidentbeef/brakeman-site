This release sheds a couple dependencies and adds support for new Ruby 2.3 syntax.

_Changes since 3.1.5_:

* Support calls using `&.` operator ([#796](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/796))
* Handle CoffeeScript in HAML ([#813](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/813))
* Avoid render warnings about `params[:action]`/`params[:controller]` ([#812](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/812))
* Only update ignore config file on changes ([#824](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/824))
* Sort ignore config file
* Index calls in class bodies but outside methods ([#814](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues/814))
* Skip Symbol DoS check on Rails 5
* Fix finding calls with `targets: nil`
* Remove `fastercsv` dependency
* Remove `multi-json` dependecy

### Ruby 2.3 Lonely Operator

With the update of RubyParser to 3.8.1 (and Ruby2Ruby to 2.3), Brakeman now supports the new `&.` operator and should treat it like a regular method call.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/827))

### CoffeeScript in HAML

This release handles CoffeeScript embedded in HAML better and should reduce some false positives.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/817))

### Render Warnings on Safe Parameters

Brakeman will no longer warn on `render params[:action]` or `render params[:controller]`, as those values are not able to be controlled by an attacker.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/816))

### 'Ignore' Configuration Changes

The "ignore config" files generated by Brakeman are now sorted and will only update on changes, instead of always writing a new file.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/828))

### Index Calls Outside Methods

Calls that are outside methods (but inside class bodies) can now be found in Brakeman checks.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/815))

### Skip Symbol DoS with Rails 5

Rails 5 requires Ruby >= 2.2.2, which now garbage collects symbols. If the `SymbolDoS` check is run on a Rails 5 application (it's already optional), it will no longer warn.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/829))

### Dependency Removal

Since Ruby 1.8 is no longer supported, this release removes the legacy `fastercsv` and `multi-json` dependencies.

([fastercsv](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/822), [multi-json](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/818))
