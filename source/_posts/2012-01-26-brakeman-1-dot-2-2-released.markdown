## No Progress Option

The last release broke the `--no-progress` option for hiding the `1/100 files processed` type messages. Now it works again!

## Separate Check for link_to

For no great reason, `CheckLinkTo` was bundled with `CheckCrossSiteScripting`. It has now been moved out to a separate file, allowing it to be treated as a regular check. This means it can be explicitly skipped using `-x CheckLinkTo` (if desired).

## Better Rails 2 Route Handling

Brakeman was raising an exception if a hash option to `resource` or `resources` did not match a set of known options. Now it will only warn instead of aborting route processing.
