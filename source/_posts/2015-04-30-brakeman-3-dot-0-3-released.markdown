This is mostly a bug fix release, but does introduce a new warning code for when `protect_from_forgery` is not set to raise exceptions in Rails 4.


## New CSRF Warning

[Neil Matatall](https://github.com/oreoshake) has added a warning for Rails 4 applications that do not pass the `with: :exception` option to `protect_from_forgery`. The default behavior of clearing out the session (but still processing the request) has lead to vulnerabilities in some applications. GitHub [recently awarded a bug bounty](https://bounty.github.com/researchers/LukasReschke.html) for a vulnerability caused by this behavior.

## Additional Rake Task

[Masarakki](https://github.com/masarakki) added a Rake task that will exit with an error code if any warnings are found (like `brakeman -z`). The task can be run with `rake brakeman:check`.

However, please note the use of Rake tasks to run Brakeman is discouraged, since it loads the entire Rails application which is unnecessary and may cause conflicts with Brakeman dependencies.

## Reduce SQL Injection False Positives

A patch from [Gabriel Sobhrinho](https://github.com/sobrinho) removes warnings about `quoted_table_name` in SQL queries.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/647))

An additional change was made to ignore more Arel methods nested inside of other queries. This should reduce many of the false positives seen with combining Arel and ActiveRecord queries.

## Remote Code Execution in open()

As noted in [Egor Homakov's blog post](http://sakurity.com/blog/2015/02/28/openuri.html), `open` can actually be used to spawn new processes by starting the argument with a pipe `|`. Brakeman will now warn about remote code execution via `open`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/643))

## Simple Guard Conditions

Brakeman should now recognize guard conditions that look exactly like this:

    if [1, 2, "a", "b"].include? x
      do_something_dangerous_with x
    end

This may resolve some false positives. If you have code similar to this, please consider [opening an issue](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues) and perhaps it can be handled similarly.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/640))

## Lambda Filters

Filters that use lambdas instead of blocks should now be handled correctly.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/649))

## Handle to_s in SQL

Values with `to_s` called on them were being ignored when checking for SQL injection. This has been fixed.
