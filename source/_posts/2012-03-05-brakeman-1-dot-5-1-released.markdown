After the excitment yesterday with a mass assignment vulnerability being exploited in a very public manner on [Github](https://gist.github.com/1978249), interest in Brakeman has skyrocketed.

This lead to re-examination of Brakeman's code for detecting that mass assignment has been globally disabled - and it turns out there was a bug or two. So here is a bug-fix release of Brakeman to correct that and some other minor issues.

Upgrading to 1.5.1 may increase the number of warnings reported.


## Mass Assignment

Mass assignment is not a particularly new issue, but the amount of attention suddenly focused on it this weekend was amazing.

This release of Brakeman can detect three different methods for defaulting all models to a whitelist of allowed attributes that can be mass assigned.

The first is probably the most widely-seen version. In an intializer, do

    ActiveRecord::Base.send(:attr_accessible, nil)

The second is essentially equivalent, but 1.5.1 adds support for it as well:

    module ActiveRecord
      class Base
        attr_accessible nil
      end
    end

The third option is only available for Rails 3.1.0 and newer. The following configuration setting can be added to `application.rb`:

    config.active_record.whitelist_attributes = true

Brakeman should correctly detect all of these.

[This is a very nice post](http://pragtob.wordpress.com/2012/03/06/secure-your-rails-apps/) explaining the dangers of mass assignment (mentioning Brakeman is nice, too.)

## Partials in Rails 3

In Rails 3, `render 'blah'` is now equivalent to `render :partial => 'blah'` when used inside a template.

Brakeman now supports this correctly.

## Debug Output

More debugging output has been added for use with the `-d` option.

Additionally, when interrupting the application (for example, with `^C`), a stack trace will be output. Please note, however, that this only works with Ruby 1.9.

## Internal Changes

There have been a few internal changes. There is a possibility that these will affect some warnings. However, it should only result in accurate reporting of class names.

## Report Issues

Please report any problems on [Github](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/issues)!
