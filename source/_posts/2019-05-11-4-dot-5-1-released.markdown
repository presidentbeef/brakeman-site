This release adds initial support for Rails 6!


## Initial Rails 6 Support

Rails 6 is (almost?) here!

This release adds basic support internally for Rails 6 as well as the `-6` option to force Rails 6 mode.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1335))

## Optional Check for Force SSL Option

In Rails, `config.force_ssl = true` turns on HSTS, redirects HTTP to HTTPS, and sets the `secure` flag on all cookies.

A new optional check has been added to check if this option is enabled.

To enable this new check, use `-A` or `--enable ForceSSL`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1344))

## Deserialization with Oj

The deserialization check now looks for unsafe use of the `Oj` JSON library.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1334))

## New SQL Injection Sinks

The SQL injection check has been expanded to check for unsafe use of `destroy_by`/`delete_by` (new in Rails 6) and `find_or_create_by` and related methods.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1337))

## `link_to` with Block

Brakeman now checks `link_to` calls with blocks for `javascript:` links.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1340))

## Convert `!!` to Boolean

Use of `!!` to convert values to booleans will be treated as safe (turned into `true or false`).

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1345))

## Relative Path for `__FILE__`

When ruby\_parser parses `__FILE__`, it replaces it with the name of the current file. Unfortunately, Brakeman was passing in absolute paths for the current file.
This meant that the fingerprints for warnings including `__FILE__` would vary based on the path where the code was scanned. 

Now a relative path is used instead, so fingerprints should stabilize.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1347))

## `Brakeman::FilePath`

Internally, file paths are now represented with `Brakeman::FilePath` to make it easier to manage absolute/relative paths as needed. This was a pretty huge change, so please report any issues.

As a result, the `--no-separate-models` option no longer works (it used to combine all model-level mass assignment warnings into one warning).
That old option used to report a completely messed-up file name, which is incompatible with `Brakeman::FilePath`. Also, it was weird and wrong.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1354))

## Empty Partial Names

If any empty string ends up as a partial name in a `render` call, Brakeman will ignore it.
