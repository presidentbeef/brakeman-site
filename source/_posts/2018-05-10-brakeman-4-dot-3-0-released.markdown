Did you know we recently broke [11 million gem downloads](http://bestgems.org/gems/brakeman)? Wow!


## `--color` Option

Previously, `--no-color` could be used to turn off ANSI color in text reports. Now, `--color` can be used to force color output.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1176))

## `--parser-timeout` Option

The default timeout for parsing a single file is 10 seconds. For some files, this may not be enough.

The `--parser-timeout` option can be used to specify a per-file timeout (in seconds).

Additionally, the error message for parsing timeouts has been improved considerably.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1194))

## Command Injection Fixes

Thanks to [Jacob Evelyn](https://github.com/JacobEvelyn) reporting a number of issues around command injection, there are several improvements.

Use of backticks as targets of a call will now be checked for command injection.

For example:

    `blah #{something}` == "expected output"

Previously, use of backticks was not being indexed in this case.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1185))

Somewhat similarly, other calls (such as `system`) would not warn if they were targets of a call.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1200))

Brakeman will no longer warn about `Process.pid` in system calls.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/commit/f9195312931caa49e369730a0798dad750150f76))

Also fixed an issue where searching for string interpolation would return the innermost instance instead of the first instance (typically you want the first one).

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1195))

## Freeze Calls

Calls to `String#freeze` will essentially be ignored.

    "blah".freeze

will be treated like

    "blah"

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1188)) 

## More Strong Parameters in SQL

Calls to `to_h` and `to_hash` on `params` will be ignored in the context of SQL injection.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1191))

## Sanitize in `link_to`

Brakeman will now warn on uses of `sanitize` in attempts to avoid XSS in `link_to`. Unfortunately, it does not work that way.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1192))

## `Array#join` to String Interpolation

Uses of `Array#join` will now be converted to string interpolation.

For example:

    [1, thing, "here"].join(' ')

will be changed to

    "1 #{thing} here"

This both fixes some false positives and helps detect more vulnerabilities in checks that are looking at string interpolation.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1198))

## Parent Calls

Brakeman now tracks the parent method call (I'm sure there's a better way to say that) of an argument. While this ended up not being needed for this release, it will help improve checks and messages in the future.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1193))
