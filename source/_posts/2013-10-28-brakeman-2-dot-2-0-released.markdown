This is a small release, with some bug and false positive fixes alongside initial support for Rails engines and a new check for detailed exceptions.


## Rails Engines

[Geoffrey Hichborn](https://github.com/phene) added support for checking Rails engines paths when searching for controllers, models, and views. Please let us know if there are any issues or files missed with this change.

## Redirects with Friendly ID

Thanks to [AJ Ostrow](https://github.com/aj0strow), Brakeman should no longer warn on redirects to models using `friendly_id`.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/400))

## Detailed Exceptions

[Nathaniel Talbott](https://github.com/ntalbott) suggested checking that detailed exceptions (treating requests as local) are not enabled in production.

Brakeman now generates a warning in a new category called "[Information Disclosure](http://brakemanscanner.org/docs/warning_types/information_disclosure/)" if `config.consider_all_requests_local` is set to `true` in production or a controller overrides `show_detailed_exceptions?` to return something other than `false`.

Please see the [changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/396) regarding the new category and two new warning codes associated with these warnings.

## Better Version Detection

Brakeman now uses the Rails version found in `Gemfile` or `Gemfile.lock` to determine when to enable Rails 3/4 mode, which seems obvious in retrospect. This required swapping when the `Gemfile` and the configuration files are processed.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/402))

## Rails 3 Routes 

A small fix prevents Brakeman from raising an error when a route is a redirect or any value other than a string or symbol.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/403))

## Command Injection False Positives

There should be fewer false positives for command injection when interpolated values are literals. The check also now ignores commonly used values `RAILS_ROOT`, `Rails.env`, and `Rails.root`.

Additionally, reported "dangerous" values (`user_input` in JSON reports) for command injection are more specific. For example:

    system "rm -rf #{some_var}"

used to report the entire string `"rm -rf #{some_var}"` as dangerous, even though it's really warning about the interpolation of `some_var`. Now Brakeman will report the first potentially dangerous interpolated value. Note that this does not change fingerprints for existing warnings.
