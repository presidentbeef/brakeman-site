Mostly false positive reduction and bug fixes in this one!


## Safe Literals

This version of Brakeman introduces a new way of handling "known safe" values (integers, string literals, etc.) where the *exact* value is unknown. The uses of the values will be replaced with `:BRAKEMAN_SAFE_LITERAL` instead of actual values, as Brakeman had done previously. The new approach avoids some unhelpful side-effects and allows for more of this kind of thing in the future.

These changes fix up a number of false positives.

#### Array Safe Literals

In situations like

    ["hello", "there"].each do |s|
      something_with(s)
    end

Brakeman will replace `s` inside the block with `:BRAKEMAN_SAFE_LITERAL`, since the value must be a string (or `nil`, but Brakeman doesn't worrry about that).

`Array#map` and `Array#each` are currently supported.

#### Hash Access with Unknown Key

In code like

    some_hash = { x: 1, y: 2}
    result = some_hash[some_var]

Brakeman will replace `result` with `:BRAKEMAN_SAFE_LITERAL` since the value must be an integer.

## Symbolized Keys in Params

Calls to `params.symbolize_keys` in ActiveRecord methods will not be treated as dangerous.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1217))

## Conditionals in Shell Commands

Use of interpolated `if` expressions (or the ternary version) in shell commands is now handled better, thanks to [Jacob Evelyn](https://github.com/JacobEvelyn). The values of the branches will be checked for dangerous values before warning.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1214))

## Update ERB Use for Ruby 2.6

The interface for ERB will be [updated in Ruby 2.6](https://github.com/ruby/ruby/blob/2311087/NEWS#stdlib-updates-outstanding-ones-only). [Koichi ITO](https://github.com/koic) provided a fix in preparation for this change.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1220))

## Frozen Objects

Since the use of `freeze` is of little interest to Brakeman and obscures the object it is freezing, these calls are now ignored.

This, especially combined with the safe literals above, cleans up some false positives.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1230))

## Foreign Keys in SQL

Brakeman will now ignore calls to `foreign_key` in SQL strings.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1229))

## Not `Module#included` Calls

Calls to `included` outside of modules/classes will be ignored instead of causing an error.
