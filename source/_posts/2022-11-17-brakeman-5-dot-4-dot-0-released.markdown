Special thanks to [Bart de Water](https://github.com/bdewater) and [Ryan Cartner](https://github.com/tehryanx) for proposing new rules!


## Check RSA Key Sizes and Padding Modes

Brakeman now warns on:

* RSA key sizes less than 2048 bits
* Use of padding modes other than OAEP (including `none`)

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1737))

## Unexpected Absolute Paths

When joining paths using `Pathname#join`, any arguments that start with a forward slash (`/`) will cause the rest of the path to be relative to that absolute path. This may cause unexpected behavior and deviates from how `File.join` works.

```ruby
Pathname.new('a').join('b', '/c', 'd')
 => #<Pathname:/c/d>
```

(There are more `Pathname` methods with this issue - to be added in a future release.)

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1733))

## Multiple Values in `when`s

If a `when` clause contains only 'safe' values, Brakeman will treat the `case` value as safe:

```ruby
y = [1, 2, 3]

case x
when *y
  maybe_dangerous(x) # `x` must be an integer, so not dangerous
end
```

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1734))

## Ignore More Redirects

More model methods are ignored in redirects:

* `first!`
* `last!`
* `sole`
* `find_by_sole`

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1732))

## Rails Defaults

[James Gregory-Monk](https://github.com/jamgregory) fixed how Rails default configuration values are set so overrides were properly handled.

([changes](https://github.com/presidentbeef/brakeman/pull/1719))
